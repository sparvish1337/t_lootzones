# QB-Core/Qbox Loot Zones

A **FiveM** script for **QB-Core & Qbox** that spawns lootable props in designated zones. Players can search these props to receive a random item based on loot tier probabilities. The loot props automatically respawn after a cooldown period.

---

## üìå Features
‚úÖ **Loot Zones:** Different zones with configurable loot tiers (**low, medium, high**).  
‚úÖ **Random Loot:** Players receive **one** random item from the tier-based loot table.  
‚úÖ **Prop Interaction:** Uses **ox_target** for searching loot props.  
‚úÖ **Cooldown System:** Lootable props respawn after a configurable time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dependencies**  
Ensure you have the following resources installed:
- [qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core)
- [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Download & Install**  
1. **Clone or download** this repository and place it inside your `resources` folder.
2. Add the following line to your **server.cfg**:
   ```ini
   ensure t_lootzones
   ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configuration**  
Modify `config.lua` to customize loot zones, props, loot tables, and respawn cooldown:
```lua
Config.LootZones = {
    { tier = "low", coords = vector3(124.81, -1071.83, 29.19), radius = 10.0 },
    { tier = "medium", coords = vector3(73.13, -1054.94, 29.42), radius = 20.0 },
    { tier = "high", coords = vector3(70.33, -1139.59, 29.27), radius = 30.0 },
}

Config.LootTables = {
    low = { { item = "water", min = 1, max = 3 }, { item = "bread", min = 1, max = 2 } },
    medium = { { item = "ammo-9", min = 1, max = 30 }, { item = "cash", min = 10, max = 100 } },
    high = { { item = "weapon_pistol", min = 1, max = 1 }, { item = "cash", min = 10, max = 100 } },
}

Config.RespawnCooldown = 300 -- Time in seconds
```

## üîß How It Works
1. When the resource starts, **loot props** spawn inside the configured zones.
2. Players can **search** a loot prop via **ox_target**.
3. A **random item** from the loot table is given to the player.
4. The **loot prop disappears** and will **respawn after the cooldown**.
